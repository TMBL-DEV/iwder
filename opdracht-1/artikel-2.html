          The two most popular open source HTTP web servers in the world have been fighting over a clear share on the
          market. They both can provide a complete web stack, but NGINX is said to support dynamic content better —
          tempting for VPS and dedicated hosting users, and Apache speed and performance stays a benefit for shared
          hosting clients. Let’s have a look at the most common advantages and disadvantages of the two rivals.
        </p>

        <p>
          NGINX was an answer to “how to get one web server to handle 10,000 connections, given the limitations of the
          operating systems?” problem, commonly known as the C10K problem. It can be easily scaled on minimal hardware,
          focuses on core web server and proxy features. Most importantly, it does not manage threads the same way
          Apache does. It does not set up a new process for each web request — it combines worker processes, and each of
          them handles multiple connections. The mechanism loops the requests, checking and processing events and works
          on a connection only when an event is triggered. Nginx is an asynchronous, non-blocking, event-driven
          connection handling algorithm, that is designed to serve static content quickly and to handle dynamic requests
          off to other software.

        <h2>Static Content</h2>
        <p>Apache uses MPM methods to handle static content, and NGINX because of different methods of handling threads
          has a much greater performance. It is about 2.5 faster than Apache — tested on 1k concurrent connections. With
          512 concurrent connections NGINX showed to be two times faster.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dynamic Content</h2>
        <p>
          Apache process dynamic content by it’s MPM work models. It sets a processor into it’s worker instances, which
          allows to execute dynamic content in the web server, not having to use third-party components. NGINX does not
          handle the dynamic content internally — all dynamic requests are passed to external processor for execution.
          It communicates with the processor through protocols like http, FastCGI, SCGI, uWSGI, memcache, and waits for
          the rendered content response. This means, that static content responds quicker on NGINX as the dynamic
          content is not embedded in the server’s native work process, but when it comes to dynamic performance
          measurements, Apache and NGINX go head to head. They both handle the same concurrency in PHP runtime
          environment and almost the same performance in other languages.
        </p>

        <h2>Operating system</h2>
        <p>
          Both Apache and NGINX run on Unix-like systems, but only Apache has a full support Microsoft Windows support.
          That does not mean that NGINX can’t handle Microsoft, just Apache performs a bit better in this matter.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>Directory-level configuration in Apache allows to interpret directives within the content directories
          themselves — the files interpreted by Apache are called .htaccess files. They are kept in the content
          directories and Apache checks the components for .htaccess files to apply the directives within them. Those
          files are not supported by NGINX and the server does not provide outside configuration. However, there are
          some positives about that situation — when system directory-level .htaccess files are called out, Apache
          checks for those files in every parent directory, reads and interprets them for each request. Meanwhile, NGINX
          handles request faster, as it does a single directory lookup.
