        You can version a design system’s component library as a single
        package (e.g. Polaris v8.0), or you can version each component within
        the library as its own mini package (e.g. Atlaskit Badge v15.0.8) This
        post breaks down the pros and cons of versioning the whole library vs
        individual components.

      <h2>versioning the whole library</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: start">whole library pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Simpler</strong> – The <code>package.json</code> file at
          the root of the component library folder manages the version for
          all of the design system’s components and assets. Library
          maintainers publish a new version that contains all the
          components, and library consumers bump the version number in their
          project to receive the latest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ensure library quality</strong>
          – Stability is critical for a design system’s codebase. Versioning
          the library as a whole means that maintainers can confidently say
          the group of components contained in the library are all
          compatible with one another. It also makes testing across versions
          of the library possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easier to sync with design tools and documentation</strong>
          – Design tools unfortunately don’t (yet) have the same robust
          versioning capabilities as code libraries. A design system’s UI
          kit and code library should be in sync, and sharing version
          numbers is one way to accomplish that. Managing a single version
          number for a UI kit is easier than managing individual version
          numbers for each component.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="text-align: start">whole library cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Potential to introduce distractions and bottlenecks for
            downstream developers</strong>
          – Large products consuming the design system might have many teams
          working on different parts of it (Homepage team! Checkout team!
          Product Detail Page team!). If changes — specifically breaking
          changes — are introduced, product developers have to distract
          themselves from their priorities to address the breaking changes
          introduced by the library — even if those breaking changes aren’t
          related to anything they’re presently working on. This is why
          SemVer should be used and breaking changes need to be handled with
          care.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>versioning individual components</h2>
      <h3>individual components pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User developers only update what they need</strong> – Did
          the datepicker update? Great! The team relying on it can pull down
          the latest datepicker package without having to concern themselves
          with changes to any other packages (except for the ones that are
          dependencies of the component in question).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developer teams can control when to make updates</strong>
          – Because teams only pull down updates to the components they’re
          focused on, they can determine the timeline for updating other
          components from the library.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>individual components cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>More overhead</strong> – Individually versioning each
          component requires more effort for both library maintainers and
          consumers. Library maintainers need to set up a tool like Lerna in
          order to manage the individual packages, and the consuming teams
          need to consider the version of each component on a given page in
          addition to keeping track of individual component dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Can’t ensure library quality and compatibility</strong>
          – It is impossible to test against all the version combinations of
          all components in the library. Is Button v3.4 compatible with
          Accordion 1.2 and Modal 5.3? Library maintainers can’t guarantee
          quality, which means when issues arise consuming teams and
          maintainers have go on an easter egg hunt to pin down where
          compatibility problems are occurring. The maintainers then need to
          cut a new patch version of the component, but can’t guarantee that
          patch doesn't introduce further bugs with other component versions
          elsewhere. Lose some of the full value of a design system – Design
          systems offer many benefits, especially around product consistency
          and quality. With individual component versioning, some of that
          consistency and quality is lost, and other benefits like easily
          rolling out turnkey redesigns are inhibited if versions are
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>scattered or incompatible. Can lead to increased page
            weight</strong>
          - If Button v12 is the latest and greatest, but Modal v4.3 relies
          on Button v3.8, then users can unwittingly end up with multiple
          versions of the same component on their pages. This leads to
          increased bloat and slower performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Can’t orchestrate with design tools and documentation</strong>
          – as mentioned above, design tools and reference websites aren’t
          terribly sophisticated with versioning. Designers likely aren’t
          thinking about mixing Accordion v2.3 and TextPassage 4.3 and
          instead think of them of wielding a cohesive design language. On
          the documentation front, it can be challenging or impossible to
          capture the many versions of individual components and keep track
          of what guidelines and options are available from version to
          version
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>of course it depends</h2>
      <p>
        In our work, we favor versioning the library as a whole rather than
        individual components for the reasons outlined above. In our
        experience, the only time breaking changes are introduced post v1.0
        are for significant overhauls of things that touch pretty much the
        whole library, such as introducing new typography, rolling out
        entirely new redesigns, and so on. In our experience, post-v1.0 it’s
        unusual for individual components to need breaking API changes or
        significant redesigns that aren’t also needed elsewhere. In those rare
        cases, we coordinate with the consuming teams and their roadmap before
        releasing any breaking change, and then provide support as the teams
        are addressing those changes.
      </p>
      <p>Another consideration around which versioning strategy to choose has to do with the design system’s reach. If a
        design system is primarily powering a digital product or two, then it makes sense for that product to manage the
        library version as a site-wide consideration to ensure cohesiveness and quality. For design systems powering
        dozens or hundreds of applications of many shapes, sizes, technologies, and ages, individual packaging might be
        the only way to incrementally adopt the system. But recognize that fragmented approach dampens some of the most
        obvious benefits design systems provide, especially consistency and quality.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>versioning different facets of a system</h2>
      <p>Irrespective of the strategy used to version each component of the library, i might make sense to treat
        different
        facets of a design system as independent products with their own versioning.</p>

      <p>For instance, <strong>both design tokens and icons can often operate a bit independently of a component
          library</strong>,
        especially if those assets are consumed by other environments beyond the design system’s component library (this
        is especially true for supporting native platforms like iOS and Android). In these cases, it might make sense to
        treat icons and/or design tokens as standalone products that then get consumed by other component libraries as a
        product dependency.
      </p>
      <p>There’s a lot that goes into creating successful design systems that teams feel confident about using.
        Versioning
        is one of those things. <strong>
          While these conversations tend to focus on the technical implementation, it’s important
          to
          recognize that (like most design system challenges) these are ultimately people problems. Focus on the
          relationship between library maintainers and library users, and establish sound processes and governance
          models
          to
          build trust in the system and its team.
        </strong></p>
